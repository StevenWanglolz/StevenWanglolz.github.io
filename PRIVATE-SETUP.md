# 🔐 Private Demo Setup Guide

## ✅ **SECURE SOLUTION - No Public Credentials!**

Your demo is now **completely private**. No one can access it without your personal credentials!

## 🚀 **First Time Setup:**

### **1. Visit Your Demo:**
Go to: `https://stevenwanglolz.github.io/`

### **2. Set Your Access Code:**
- You'll be prompted to set an access code (8+ characters)
- This is stored locally on YOUR browser only
- Example: `MySecret2024`

### **3. Set Your Passwords:**
- You'll be prompted to set admin password
- You'll be prompted to set demo user password
- Both stored locally on YOUR browser only
- Must include: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character

## 🔒 **How It Works:**

✅ **Local Storage Only** - Credentials stored in YOUR browser
✅ **No Public Access** - No one else can see your credentials
✅ **Personal Setup** - You set your own passwords
✅ **Secure by Default** - No hardcoded credentials in code

## 🎯 **For Demo Sharing:**

### **Option 1: Share Your Credentials**
- Tell people your access code and login credentials
- They can only use them if they know them

### **Option 2: Set Up on Their Browser**
- Have them visit your demo site
- They'll be prompted to set their own credentials
- Each person has their own private setup

### **Option 3: Temporary Access**
- You can temporarily change to simple passwords
- Share those with demo audience
- Change back to secure passwords after demo

## 🛠️ **Managing Your Credentials:**

### **Change Access Code:**
```javascript
window.demoProtection.changeAccessCode()
```

### **Change Admin Password:**
```javascript
window.userManager.changePassword("admin")
```

### **Change Demo Password:**

```

## 🔐 **Security Benefits:**
