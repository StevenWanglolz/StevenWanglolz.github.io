# 🔐 Private Demo Setup Guide

## ✅ **SECURE SOLUTION - No Public Credentials!**

Your demo is now **completely private**. No one can access it without your personal credentials!

## 🚀 **First Time Setup:**

### **1. Visit Your Demo:**
Go to: `https://stevenwanglolz.github.io/`

### **2. Automatic Setup:**
- Access code is automatically generated and stored locally
- Admin password is automatically generated and stored locally  
- Demo user password is automatically generated and stored locally
- All credentials are unique to YOUR browser only

### **3. Get Your Credentials:**
- Open browser console (F12) after first visit
- You'll see all your credentials displayed
- Copy them down for your records

## 🔒 **How It Works:**

✅ **Local Storage Only** - Credentials stored in YOUR browser
✅ **No Public Access** - No one else can see your credentials
✅ **Personal Setup** - You set your own passwords
✅ **Secure by Default** - No hardcoded credentials in code

## 🎯 **For Demo Sharing:**

### **Option 1: Share Your Credentials**

- They'll be prompted to set their own credentials
- Each person has their own private setup

### **Option 3: Temporary Access**
